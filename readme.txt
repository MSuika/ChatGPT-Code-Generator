Code Generator
The purpose of this application is to generate code based on a given prompt using the OpenAI API. It can be used to quickly generate code snippets, prototypes, or even entire programs. The generated code can be saved to a file and used in other projects.

Installation

Before using this application, you must install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install`

You will also need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project and set the following environment variables:

OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID=<your OpenAI organization ID>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>

To obtain an OpenAI API key, you will need to create an account on the OpenAI website. Once you have created an account, you can obtain an API key from the dashboard.

Usage

To use this application, run the following commands:

`npm init -y'
`npm i` or `npm install`
`node app.js`

This will prompt you to enter a code prompt. The prompt should describe what you want the generated code to do. For example, you might enter "code react.js header". Once you enter a prompt, the application will generate code based on the prompt using the OpenAI API.

The generated code will be appended to a file named generatedCode.js in the root directory of the project. Each time you enter a prompt, the generated code will be appended to the file on a new line.

To exit the application, enter "exit" when prompted for a code prompt.

Working Principles

The application works by using the OpenAI API to generate code based on a given prompt. The openai module is used to interact with the OpenAI API, and the dotenv module is used to load environment variables from a .env file.

When the application starts, it creates a readline interface for reading user input. The user is prompted to enter a code prompt, and the application generates code based on the prompt using the generateCode function.

The generateCode function makes a request to the OpenAI API to generate code based on the prompt. The max_tokens parameter controls the length of the generated code, and the temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated code.

Once the code is generated, it is appended to the generatedCode.js file using the appendCodeToFile function. The fs module is used to interact with the file system.

The application continues to prompt the user for code prompts until the user enters "exit".
